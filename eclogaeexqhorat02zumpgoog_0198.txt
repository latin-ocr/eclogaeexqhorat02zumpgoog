Non nt superbas invidae Carthaginis

Romanus arces ureret,

intactus eut Britannus ut descenderet

Sacra catenatus via,

sed ut, secundum vota Parthorum, sua

Urbs haec eriret dextera.

Nunquam nisi indispar feris

Furorne caecos an rapit vis acrior

An culpat Responsum date.

Tacent, et albus ora pallor inficit,

Mentesqne perculsae stupent.

Sic est: acerba fata Romanos egunt

Scelusqne fraternae necis,

Ut immerentis fluxit in terram Remi

Sacer nepotibus cruor.
