not unsuccessfully Horace, as it appears, became tha chief lite
rary assistant of Maecenas: he gave him information about new l
books, helped him m his own compositicns, and wrote poema for
hia gratificaticn and amusement. A great part of tha Satires, for ,³
instance, was undoubtedly intended primarily for Maecenas aud ³
the intellectusl circle that he had drawn around him. Horace ¹
acted alac as his secretary in such state affairs ashe had to attend
to. This is apparent from the aiath Satira of the second hook,
where a person requests Horace to obtain the signatura os Mae·
cenas to a paper, asking his assistance quita in the styla in which
one addresses tha secretary of a great man. Inone passage, also,
Horace complains that the amount of business which ha has to go
through at Rome preventa him from having any leisure. The
favour of Maecenas soon obtained forour poet the means of rnalr· ’
ing a sufficient livelihood: he became a salba. This ha himself
indicates in aar. ii. 6, 36; and his biographer Suetonius says, ¹
emptum qrmerfmiurn comparavit-‘he bought for himself a clerir-
alrip to tha quaestore! These miliae formed by no means an
uninflueutial class in Rome. They wera tha under-secretaries in
all the governmant departments,·and the affairs of the state wara
in a great measure managed by them. Tha chief secretarios were
changed annually, and consequently could ba but very imper-
fectly acquainted with the dutiea of their office, which therefore
devolved necessarily on the ιιτὶὸαι, they holding their posta for
lise. The state required from tha rasta sacurlty for good eon·
duct and integrity, and thus it happened that they formed a

. strong and exclusive corporati0u3 and their offices bacam sale·
able, lilre commissione in the British army. Aa ιο how Horace
contrived to unita liis new duties with his employments at the
house cf Maecenas, we can only form conjectures Either he was
allowed to perform the duties of scriba by proxy, or he performed
them at tha house of Maecenas, since tha latter, being often
engaged in state affairs, could not dispensa 'with tlie attendance
of his secretary. This, however, is certain-that Horace gradu·
ally withdraw himself from business, and gained leisura enough
ιο follow his poetical inclinatione undisturbed.

At first, perhaps, Horace lived in tha house of Maecenas, and
was treated as a dependaut; but as the latter became more
acquainted with the poat’s merita, he gave him greater freedom
and independenca. Let us now imagine to ourselves Horace’s
condition and moda of speuding his time. He has hisownhouse
in town, with three servantsto wait upon him. Hehasbisown x
particular friends and associatae, but ha goes, perhaps daily, at a
certain honr, ιο the house cf Maecenas on tha Esquilina Hirr,
and to a special invitation from his patron even a promise made
ιο another must give way. Out of Roma Horace possessas a
