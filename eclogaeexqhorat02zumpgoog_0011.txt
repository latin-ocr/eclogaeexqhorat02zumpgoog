seeing that rn Greelr poetry no laurels were now to be won,
whereas the Latin literature of his time had but few great poeta
to point to (Sat. i. 10, 31.) His quiet was broken in upon by
the civil war3 of which the republican party, under Brutus and
Cassius, transferred the seat ιο Graece. Youog Horace was
enthusiastic for liberty, whose representative Brutus was consi-
dered to be. He therefore joined the republican army as a volun·
teet, and was soon advanced by Brutus ιο the ranlr of tribunae
militum. This was a high honour for tbe son of a freedman to
obtain, especially one who had no great fortune; consequently
envious enemies were not wanting, but still he wes able to main·

a few continued the war under Sex. Pompeius aud Domitius

he could hope ιο rise by his abilities.

His patrimonial estate, which had never been large, had during

but by the general calamities of the country. The triumvirs had

estates. ln the most flourishing cities of Italy the owners of land
were obliged to give up their property ιο tire soldiers. Compen-
