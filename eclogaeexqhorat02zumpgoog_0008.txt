and alter him many learned men directed their attention to the
explanation of Horace's languag eand allusions, till the time ot⁴
Richard Bentley, whose first edition was published at Cambridge
in l'lll. Bentley, by this edition, established his farne as a
decided genius in criticism. He altered the' textos Horace in
about eight hundred passages, often according to tlie readings os
manuscripts (for he had many, and some were excellent); olten
also, however, upon simple conjecture. More modern critica
have perceived that many ofBentley’s corrections were not what
the poet rwrote, but merely what he might bave written. But
even in his unsuccesssul emendations, he has affordrnl to later
critica and commentatore rich and interesting materiale for de·
bate, from which none has been able to escape. ln the present
edition, considering that it is intended chiefly sor schools, we
have seldom mentioned Bentley’s name3 burin many casea we
have been unable to refrain from tonching, generally in a very
few words, upon points about which he has raised controver-
sies. The direction that the criticism on Horace has taken since
Bentley’s time is the poeticoaesthetic, the character oi which is
best developed in Mitscherlich's somewhat diffuse, but yet erudite
and judicious edition os the Odes (Leipzig, 1800.) Very recently,
Jo. Casp. Orelli-whose third editioribus appeared in the year
1850—has endeavoured to combine the explanatory and aesthetic
style os commentary witha new critical recension. We have
taken his text as the basis os oure, paying caresul regard, how·
ever, both to former editions ol all Horace's worlrs, and also to
the numerous editions ol detacbed portione os them, among
whichL. F. HeindorFs edition oi the Satires (Second, Leipzig,
1843) deserves particular notice.

The present edition contains nearly all the poema of Horace,
tliose only having been excluded which cannot be made use os
sor educational purposes. The commentary was began by Pro·
sessor C. G. Zumpt. He died, however, without completiug more
than the notes on the Epodes, The remainder the undersigued
lias endeavoured to executa in his lather⁷s spirit.
