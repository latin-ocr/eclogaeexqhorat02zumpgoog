stamnum LIB. 111.

Hoc caveret mens provida Reguli,
Dissentientis condicionibus
Foedis et exemplo trahentis
Perniciem veniens in aevum,

si non periret immiserabilis
Captiva pubes. ‘Signa ego Punicis
Affixa delubris et arma
Militibus sine caede‚' dixit,

‘Derepte vidi 3 vidi ego civium
Retorta tergo brachia libero
Portasque non clausas et arva
Marte coli populata nostru.

Auro te nsus scilicet acrior
Miles redi it. Flagitio additis
Damnum: neque amissos colores
Lana refert medicantium,

Nec vera virtus, cum semel excidit,
Curat reponi deterioribus. 30
