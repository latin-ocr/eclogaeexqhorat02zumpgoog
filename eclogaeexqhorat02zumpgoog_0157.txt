Qum tu, Melpomene, semel

Nascentem placido lumine videris,

illurn non labor Isthmius

Clarabit pugilem, non equus impiger
Curru ducet Achaico

0 testudinis aureae

Dulcem quae strepitum, Pieri, temperas,

und thus make himself famous-12. Fingent, = efficient, ‘will melre
him, will so truin and inspira him that he will become illustnous.'-
