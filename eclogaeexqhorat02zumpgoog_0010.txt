The poet himself was therefore sreeborn (ingsaaus); and this ’
fact, considering the great number os freedmen who lived at
Rome, and rose to wealth and influeuee, was ol iteelf something
to be proud os (compare Sat. i. 6, 7.) Horace aclrnowledges his
humble hirth3 but his education, be says, was equal to that oi
one destined for the highest position in society, although his
father would have been satielied is his son hed followed the
same calling as himself-nemely, thatosa maor (Sat. i. 6, 86),
or, os Suetonius in Horace’e lile more l'ully says, anabaust
coactor ; thetis, an egent os the ommutui, who, ior acestain per·
contage or commission, collected irorn purchasers at auctions the
money due ior what they hed bought The father, however, was
besides the possessor os a small estate near Venusia

The school at Venusia, though the town was a considerable
one, und weelthy, was yet but secondrate. It was good enough,
however, sor boys intended sor handicralis or a mereantile lite,
writing and arithmetic were taught, anderen the higher class
os citizens-the magui centuriones, as the poet calls them (Sat. i. ti,
73)-were content with it But young Flaccus was takenby his
father to Rome, to be 'educeted there. The father himself lctt his

home, settled in the capital, and accompanied his son to all the ¹

youth is liable in a large city: (compare the whole of Satire 6,
boch i.) Horace studied in Rome Latin and Greek grammar;
and asterwards, under the same teachers, rhetoric. He mentione
- (Epist. ii. 1, 71) that, when a hoy, he'attended the school ol the
grammarian Orbilius, who used to dictus passages irem the
writings osrhe old Latin poetLivius Andronicus, and give mh·

matical prelections on them. Hs also states alipta. ii, 42), that

To do so he had to become either an advocate or a soldier.
He was not inclined to¹adopt either professiou3 l'or the latter,
indeed, he probably bad not physical strength. Besides, the

His father appears to have been dead by this tirus. The most
distinguished philosopher then teachingat Athens was Cratippus
