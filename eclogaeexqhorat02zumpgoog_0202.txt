Haustus tempestas coelum contraxit, et imbres
Nivesque deducunt lovem, nunc mara nunc silvae
Threicio aquilone sonant: rapiamus amice

Et decet obducta solvatur leonte senectus. ⁵

Cetera mitte loqui: deus haec sortasse benigna

Reducet in sedem viee. N uno et Achaemenio
Perfundi nardo juvat et fide Cyllenea

Iuricte mortalis dea nata puer Thetide,

Te manet Assaraci tellus,.quam frigida parvi

lindunt Scamandri flumina lubricus et Simois,
