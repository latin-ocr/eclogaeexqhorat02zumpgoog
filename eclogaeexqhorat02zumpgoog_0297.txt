AD PISONBS.

'l'nrs poem has caused more difference ot‘ opinion among the com·
mentators than any other of Horace’s writings. Some have oon·
sidered it ss intended to be a complete system of the principles
of poetica! compositionr others as merely a friendly letter; and

· both parties bavefoundsomethingtocensure in ir. Thetruth

lies between tire two opinions. Aa Horaoe in senerai oi' his

epistles has treated of philosophia} doctrines, particularly those
of the Stoics, and in others baa prouonneed some judgments
regarding the art of poetry‚ so here, in the easy form of a letter
to friends, he gives his views os the art, formed by the experi-

ence of a life dedicated to the Muses. Hence this book is e

satirica] diductio poem, in which need be expected neither pln‘lo·

sophicnl form and arrangement, nor any great ssight of fancy. ⁶

This epistle, if not the last cf our poet’s writings‚is at least a
work of his mature age, composed probably between 11 and 8
rac.¹ and we may suppose him to have leil it as a kind of nris
by which he wished posterity to try his poetry. 'I'he epistle is
addressed to 1. Piso, consul in 15 ne„ a man distinguished as a
general end statesman‚ end particularly for the ability with
which he discharged the dntiea of matus nti,- and to his
two sons, the elder uf whom was frorn sevurteen to twenty years
of age at tire time thet Horace wrote it-a period of lise at
which interest in poetry very commonly develops itself.
