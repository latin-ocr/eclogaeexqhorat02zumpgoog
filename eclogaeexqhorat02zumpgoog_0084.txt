Jam fulgor armorum fugaces
Terret equos equitumque vultus.

Audire magnos jani videor duces,
Nou indecoro pulvere sordidos,

Et cuncta terrarum subacta

Testatur auditumque Medis
Hesperiae sonitum ruinael

Qui gurges aut quae flumina lugubris
ignara beltit Quod mare Dauniae
Non decoloravere caedes? 35
