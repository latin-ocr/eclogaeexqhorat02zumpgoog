lllum age't penna metuente solvi
Fama superstes.

Latius regnes avidum domando
Spiritum, quam si Libyam remotis
Gadibus jungas et uterque Poenus
Serviat uni.

Crescit indulgens sibi dirus hydrops,
Nec sitim pellit, nisi causa morbi
Fugerit venis et aquosus albo
Corpore languor.

Redditum Cyri solio Phraaten
Dissidens plebi numero beatorum
Eximit virtus populumque falsis
Dedecet uti

Vocibus; regnum et diadema toturn
Desarene uni propriamque laurum,

metuente solui ; that is, penna aaa non salvater or dissolvetur. The
goddess Fame is, as is well irnown, represented with wings. In

which the latter had constructed of wax. Icarus perished in the sea
called aiter him lcarian—his wings having been melted hy the heat
of the sun—10. Ranotb Gadibus, ‘to Gades (used for Spain) far

he were lord os Spain and Africa. - 13. Comparison of avarica with Ῐ
the disease of dropsy. As this disease grows, if it indulges itself ¹
(sibi indulgeam-that is, strives to quench with water the morbid ,

thirst aha should, properly, be said os tha sufl'erer, not os the dis·
easet-so also avarica, themora it hos, the more it would have.
Nothing but the conviction that virtue alone is able to malie a man
happy can eradicate this vica-17. Ptro‘atea. Phraates IV. king

os the Parthians, whom his subjects had expelled sor his cruelty, ’

had reeently (26 ao.) been reinsrated in his power by the help os
the Scythians. He was thus Cyri solio redditas, ‘restored to tho
throne of Cyrus ;' sor the Parthian monarohs considered themselves
to be the successore of the old hings of Persia-18. Dissidens plebi
