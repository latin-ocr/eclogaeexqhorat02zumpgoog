contendat, illi turba clientium
Sit major: aequa lege Necessitas
Sortitur insignes et imos,
Omne capax movet urna nornen.
Destrictus ensis cui su er impia

Cervice pendet, non Sisciae dapes
Duloem elaborabunt saporem,
Non avium citharaeque cantus 20
ὃοωηιιω reducent. Somnus agrestium
' Lenis virorum non humiles domos
Fastidit umbrosamque ripam,
Nou Zephyris agitata Tempe.

Desi arantem, quod satis est, neque 25
Tumultuosum sollicitat mare,
Nec saevus Arcturi cadentis
Impetus aut orientis Haedi,

Non verberatae grandine vineae
Fundusque mendax, arbore nunc aquas 30,
Culpante, nunc torrentia agros
Sidera, nunc hiemes iniquas.
