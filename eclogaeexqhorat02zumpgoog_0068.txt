Calabria, near the promontory of Matinum, the so-called lomb

consoles himself sor hia misfortune, recollecting how many great
men have died, and considering that all must die, and then be-
seeches the sailor who rney find his body on the bench, to throw
upon it, according to the old aad sacred cuatom, three handfuls
of earth, without which the ancients believed the chades of the
dead could not be admitted into the lower world.

Pulveris exigui prope litus parva Matinum
Munera, necquidquam tibi prodest

Occidit et Pelopis genitor, conviva deorum,
Tithonusque remotus in auras,
Et lovis arcanis Minoe admissus, habentque
Tartara Panthoiden iterum Orco ιο
