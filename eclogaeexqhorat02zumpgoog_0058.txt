Q. nouam mooI

Valles et Usticae cubantia
Levia personuere saxa.

Di me tuentur, dis pietas mea
Et musa cordi est. Hic tibi copia

Manebit ad plenum benigno 1⁵

Ruris honorum opulenta cornu
Hic tn reducta valle caniculae
Vitabis aestus et fide Teia
Dices laborantes in uno
Penelopen vitreamque Circen.
Hic innocentis pocula Lesbii
Duces sub umbra, nec Semeleius
Cum Marte confundet Thyoneus
Proelia, nec metues protervum
Suspecta Cyrum, ne male dispari
lucontiuentes injiciat manus,
Et scindat haerentem coronam
Crinibus immeritamque vestem.
