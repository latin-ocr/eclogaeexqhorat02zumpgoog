AD 0. ASINIUM POLLIONEM.

G. Asrnrm Ponnro, in whose praise this ode was written, was, both
from his high birth, and from his distinction in the political ss
well as literary world, one of the leading men of his time.
When but a youth he came prominently forward as an orator;
for we find him in 75 nc, in his twenty-third year, accnsing C.
Cato. After this he served under Caesam and during the civil
wara after Caesar's death, hc held an independent command.
In the year 43 nc. he deoided the fall of the republican party
by siding with Marlr Antony, when defeated and a fugitive, and
bringing about the triumviratc of Octavianus, Antony, and
Lepidus. In the year 40 nc. he was consul, and received in
the following year the province of Illyricum. Whilst in this'
command, he conquered the barbarous tribes os the Parthini
and Dalmatians, and took the town of Salonae. For these
victories he, on the 25th October ,39 n.c., celebrated a triumph,
which was called the Dalmatian. In the quarrels between
Octavianus and Antony he attempted, so long as it was possible,
to act as mediator, inclining, however, more to the party of the
latter3 and he could not be prevailed upon, even before the
campaign of Actium, when the ruin of Antony seemed certain,
and all his former friends were leaving him, to take the field

time when thesehisputes and quarrels were going on, andbvhen
he could not be politically active, he turned his attention to
literature, and wrote tragedias and historical worhs; among the
latter, especially, a history of the last civil wars, from the year
fio a. o. (the consulship of L. Afranius and Q. Caecilius Metellus),

when what is called the first triumvirate was formed by Pompey,
Caesar, and Crassus. Itis to be lamented, that of all Pollio’s
writings nothing except the very smallest fragments has come
