Q. nonam sanctu

' Omutis quoque piscibus
Donatura cycni, si libeat, sonum,
Totum muneris hoc tui est,
Quod monstror digito praetereuntium
‘ Romanae fidicen lyrae: '
Quod spiro et placeo, si placeo, tuum est.

this (my becoming famous) is of thy ξῆν-24. Spiro, not ‘I breathe,
live,' but ‘Iam inspired by the muse‚’ inspiratus sum.

DRUSI Laeuus.

Oua iupraise of Claudius Drusus Nero, tbe younger brother of tha
Emperor Tiberius, and stepson of Augustus. 'I'he two brothers
had, in the year 15 nc, carried ou an arduous but successful

man people; because they believed that, if he reached the
throne, he would restore the ancient freedom.

Horace, with great ahili, so constructa his ode as to give even l
greater praise to Augustus than to Drusus; for to the emperor's p
trarmng be attributes the young rnan's talenta and successes.
