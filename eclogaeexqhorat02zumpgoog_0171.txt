celemon HR. IV.

oeenuu‘rx.

An homost.

Tms ode is addressed to M. Lollius, consul in 21 a. a, a man who
at one time possessed in a high degree tho confidenoe of Augus-
tus, but lost it by his ingratitudo and insatiable aranos. In the
first part of this ode Horace treats of a subJ‘cot similer tothat of
the preceding3 namely, the power of poete to confer immortality:
in the second pert he praieee Lollius, seying much—perhaps not
without special design-os temporanee and inaccessibility to

bribes.

Ne forte credas interitura, quae

Longe sonantem natue ad Aufidum

Non ante vulgatas per artes

. Verba loquor socianda chordis:

Non, ei priores Maeonius tenet

Sedes Homerus, Pindaricae latent

Ceae uc et Alcaei minaces

Stesic orique graves Camenam
Neo, siquid olim lusit Anacreon,

Delevit aetas 3 spirat adhuc amor

vivuntque commissi calores

Aeoliae fidibus puellae.

1. Nasone medas. The epodosis begins with line 5.-2. Ad
longe sonantem Aufidum. See iii. 30, 10.-3. Non onte uolgatae
per arten ,· namely, lyric poetry. See iii. 30, 13. This ors is more
particularlp¹ defined, as verbo socianda chordis, ‘words to be oon·
nected wit the stringe) songs which are intended and ought to be
sung to the ipre-5. Priores sedes. He might also have said pri·
mas redes, but,'striotl speakinffi, there is only a comperison he·
tween two pernes- omer on t e one side, and all other poete on
the other: hence the comparative. Homer is called Maeonius, from
Maeon, which was said to be the name of his lathon- 6. Pindari-
ωε- Camenae, ‘the poema os Pindar ι’. see iv. 2, 1. Ceae refers to
the poema of Simonides, a renowned elegist, who was a native os
the island of Ceos. The songs of Alcaeus are called minaces, be·
cause they were partly war-conge, partly calls to expel the tyrants
Pittacus and Myrsilus stom Lesbos. Stesichorus, too, wrote war·
songa, end was, as it were, an apic poet in lyric dress: hence gravis.
-9. Si id :quidquid Anacreon had written love-conge, of
which ligiikino os poetry lusit ie properly used. - to. Spirat, used
fi uratively, as ιιι the next line vivunt-ll. Construe thus: colores
fetus poetice conmisrifidioos. This construction seems better
