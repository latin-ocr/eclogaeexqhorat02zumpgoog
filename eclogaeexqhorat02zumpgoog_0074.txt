AD amm.

An ode calling upon his lyre and himselfstc sing or composa in
Latin such songs as once Alcaeus, a native os the island of Lesbos,
had sung in the Greek language. The poem was written on
some occasion when his friends were urging him to write and
publish lyrica.

Lusimus tecum, quod et hunc in annum
Vivat et plures, age, dic Latinum,

Qui ferox bello, tamen inter arma,
Sive jactatam religarat udo
Litore navim,

Semper haerentem puerum canebat
Et Lycum, nigris oculis nigroque
Crine decorum.

O decus Phoebi et dapibus supremi
Grata testudo lovis, o laborum
