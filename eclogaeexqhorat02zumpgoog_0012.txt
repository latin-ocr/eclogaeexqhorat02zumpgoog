pmouldering ashes of political rancour, would have to letslip the
nuth, and flatter the ruling party. Under these circumstances, ⁸
rnen of ability took refuge in poetry and the regiousosfancy3 arrd
little else was heard now in the intellectual circlesof Rome but
recitatione of poetry and criticisms thereon. Among the dis·
tinguished poets of the tinre we may mention especially Virgil,
whose charming pastorale had delighted all, and gained for him
the favour and patronage of Octavianus3 also Varius, who hod
recommended himself by a poem on the death of Caesar3 and
' manyothers, to whom Horace occasionally alludes. Horace, too,
felt an inclination towards poetry: he says (Epist. ii. 251) that
poverty, which impels men to bold undertakiugs, had driven him
to attempt verse-making. He soughtin poetry the merrus cf sub·
sistence, by writing occasional verses. These were not directly
paid for, hutprcsents were sentin acknowledgrnent ol them, and
they gained for him the patronage of wealthy men, on whose
bounty he lived. He soon became known to his brother poeta at
Rome3 and ‚first Virgil, then Varius, spolre of him to Maecenas.
The latter invited Horace to visit him, and aslred him a few ques·
tions about his family. Horace answered timidly arrd modestly.
Maecenas theu dismissed him without any definite promise: and
it was not till nine months thereaster that he again summoned
him. and made him one of his friends (omiti.) This happened
probably in the beginning of the year 40 a. o.

Maecenas has been richly repaid for his kindncss to Horace by
the praises which the latter everywhere bestows upon him, arrd
which have made his nemea current word for ‘a patronos litera·
ture? He wasone of the most influential men in Rome3 not from
his rank or birth; but purely from his political elrill and sagacity. “
He was descended from an ancient but not a noble family ς for
none of his ancestors had held any curule office in Rome. He
was a simple Roman kniglrt, and inclined to remaitr so: though
ollen invited to take office, hc always declined‚ preferring the
quietos private life, which his wealth enabled him to enjoy, to
'the activity of a bustling political career. He was the friend
arrd confidant of Octavianus, whom he aided with his advice and
cooperation in the most critical situations; and to whorn hewse
so much attached, that at the time of the battle of Actium (30
a. n), sind previously, when Octavianus was obliged to be absent
from the city, he undertook the responsible and laborious office
of praefectus urbi. This confidence of Octavianus in Maecenas,
being well lrnowu to all, raised the latter in actual power above
most men in the state, and all aspirante to the emperor's favour
flecked to pay their homage to Maecenas. He was at the same
time well acquainted with, and‘nad afine teste for literature, and
took the deepest interest in it.) He attempted poetry himself too,
