CARMEN saneuLARn.

Ire the year 17 no. Augustus celebrated the ludi maulam. 'lhese
were instituted in the earliest times os Rome, to mark with
solemnity the longest period to which human lise was supposed
ever to ertendr but it was a disputed point whether ramulum in
regard to these games meant, as in common usage, a space of
100, or, in a peculiar religious sense, 110 years. Both views
found supporters. Augustus, aster the pacification of the em-
&indidittJtt‘kiblttlttt,ltltssithltttls’
selved to revive these gamas, which, aa Suetonius (Augurii 31)
tells us, had fallen into disuse. He ordered the Sibyllina books
to be consulted; and these, taking the cyele of 110 years, stated
the year and the mode of celebrating the festival. The next
who celebrated these garnes was the Emperor Claudius, s. u. 47
(minc. 800), following the cyele of 100 years3 then au. 88
(mmo. 841), Domitian, and an. 204 (aue. 957), Septimius
Severus, again following the rechoniug of Augustus; and lastly,
mn. 247 (ane. 1000), Philippus. 'l'he secular gemes lasted
for three days, beginning in the evening und continuing during
the night They consisted in the offering of various sacrifices to
all the gods of Rome (hence, in line 7, Dis, quibus septem plo
curre colles), and are fully described by Zosimus, ii. ⁵.

To heighten the interest of the festival, Augustus requested from
Horace a carmen roeculere, which was to be sung by a ehoir of
boys and girls. Many commentatore have been os opinion that
the song is a so-called comen nmoebueum5 thet is, consiste of
stannus intended 1ο be sung alternately by the boys and girls.
But this opinion finds no confirmation in the p'oem itself, equally
little in the description which we have of the proceedings at the
games, and is altogether improbable. In the aesthetie criticism
of the poem, we must remember that it was an official composi·
tion, in which no high flight of poetic fancy could be allowed.
It is addressed to Apollo and Diana, to whom the Sibylline books
directed a poem as well ap a sacrifice to be offered.
