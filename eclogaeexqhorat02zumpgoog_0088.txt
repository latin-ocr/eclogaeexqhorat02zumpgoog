Q. HORATII FLAOGI

Qua pinus ingens albaque populus
Umbram hospitalem consociare amant
Remis, et obliquo laborat

Floras amoenae ferre jube rosae,

villaque, flavus quam Tiberis iavit3

De gente subdivo moreris,

Victima nii miserantis Orci.

Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium
Versatur uma serius ocius
Sors exitura et nos in aeternum
Exilium impositura cymbae.
