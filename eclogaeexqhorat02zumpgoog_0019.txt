modelled it, aud was the first to bring it into general notice. This
kind os poetry wasunlrnown to the Greekst its place was snp-
plied by what was called theold Comedy, with which Horace, in
desending his Satires, classes thern. The Dromo Satyrieem was
a parody on ,tregedy The Latin word sulca is not connected
with the satyts or ihs Drama Satyriscum it comes from the ad·
jective autur, ‘sull, heaped up.¹ Hence satura means originally,

, ‘a heeping up, mining together oi heterogeueous,things,’ either in

offerings inade to the gods, or in lawa which embraced various
subjecte per saturum, ‘in the gross or slump.' Hence the old
Roman poets Ennius end Pacuvius called a poem written in
various kinds ol' verse, and probably οἱ a comio nature, a satura.
, Lucilius, about the year 120 ac, retained the name, applying it
to a ,regular hexameter poem, of the class now called serires,
which he divided into thirty books. This originated the satire,
and Horace expresslymentions Lucilius as its inventor. Horace,
however, made an improvement on its character. He gave up

personal attacks, aod the assailing oi particular individuale: iot “

- this he made useel his Epodes. InhisSatires he lashesnot single ’
scole, but lools as a class-lolly generally. The satire with him

is a didactic poem3 it gives instruction in the philosophy os lise,

lustrative exemplos. There are marked features ot' distinction also
between Horace and his successore as Roman satirists, Juvenal
and Persius, whose works are still extant. Lucilius had been
entirely personat, and principally political3 Horace, in another

age and under other political circumstances, took only the sullies ·

oi mankind as his subject: he was worldlywise, and endeavoured
to teach by showing where error lay. Juvenal inveighs against
vice with ardour and indignation3 Persius was a noble youth,
of noble spirit, desirons to regulatelile according to the maxims
of the Stoic philosophy. ln style, Lucilius wasvery free, Juve-
nal is rhetorical and regulam Persius difficult,epigrammatic, and
full oi obscurity. Horace retains throughout the tone of witty,
familiar conversation. It is for this reason thathe seems to have
given to his work, though including it in the species o'f poetry
called satire, the distinctive name os Sermones (ι Conversations.’)
This accounts also both sor the sect, that his Satires are generally
in the formos entertaining narrative, and lor the peculiarities of
their language and melre. In style, he keeps as close as possible
to‘that ol' polished prose; indeed he speaks once‘ol' the muru
pedestris in his Satires. In regard to metra, he so constructs his
hexameters that they are very different irorn the sounding lines
os heroic poetry. It would have been easier sor him, as we can
partly see from the Epistles, to follow the epic hexameters ot'
virgil, but he would not do it, that he might preserve the cha·
