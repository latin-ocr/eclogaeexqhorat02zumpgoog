Q, HORATII rusum

Tun praises of country life. At the end of the poem, aster descrih-
ing very beautifully the pleasures of a residenc'e away from the
busy haunts of men, Horace turns the matter into a johe, and
represents the picture which he has drawn as merely an
uble fancy. We must not suppose, however, that the poet really
preferred the town to the country. He did most sincerely love
the country, but his connection with Maecenas end other circum-
stances kept him much at Rome. Such time as he could spate,
he spent in the country, and this kind os mixed town and coun-
try life seems to have suited him best, for he does not deny that
he could not always enjoy the entire seclusion ot’ the country.

Burrus ille qui procul negotiis,
Ut prisce gens mortalium,
Paterna rura bobus exercet suis,

ι Solutus omni fenore,
Neque excitatur classico miles truci,
Neque horret iratum mare,
Fornmque vitat et superbe civium
Potentiorum limina.
Ergo aut adulta vitium propagine
Altos maritat populos,
Aut in reducta valle mugientium
Pros ctat errantes greges,
inuti esque falce ramos amputans
Feliciores inserit,
Aut pressa puris mella condit amphoris,
Ant tondet infirmas oves:
Vel cum decorum mitibus pomis ceput
Auctumnus egris extulit,
Ut gaudet insitiva decerpens pira
Certentem et uvam purpurae, ω
Qua muneretur te, Priape, erte, pater ,
Silvane, tutor finium.
Libet jacere modo sub antiqua ilice,
Modo in tenaci gramine.
