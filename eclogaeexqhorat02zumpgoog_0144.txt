Quorum plaustra vagas rite trahunt domos,

Vivunt et rigidi Getae,

Immetata quibus jugera liberas
Fruges et Cererem lerunt,

Nec cultura placet longimanum,

Certo loedere castitas3

Et peccare nefas aut pretium est mori.
0 quisquis volet impias

Caedes et rabiem tollere civicam,

Si quaeret aaran unsrun

Subscribi statuis, indomitam audeat
Refrenare licentiam,
