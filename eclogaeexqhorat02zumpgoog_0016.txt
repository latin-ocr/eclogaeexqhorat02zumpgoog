why, towards tho end ol his lise, his visits to Rome becamet‘ewer
and fewer. But, upon the whole, the connection between the two
friends remained the same; and ought always to be considered
¹ets a pattern for the relations between an artist or poet and hia
patron. The more tho fame of Horace increased, the more inti·
mate became his friendship with Maecenas. No petty jealousy
interfered with their mutual affection and respect. Good sors
tune preserved the friends from the necessity of s separation,
ond gratified the wish of Horace not to survive Maecenas long.
Maecenas died, after a protracted illness, iu the year 8 a. c.; and
when near his end, hc commended our poet to Augustus in the
following words: Horatii Flacci, ot mci, monor ceto. Horace sol-
lowed soon ellenon the arth of November in the some year,
having very nearly completed his fifty-aeventh year. Death took
him by surprise: hs had not timeto malie a will; but, having
no children or relations, named orally Augustus as his heir. He
was buried near his long-loved friend Maecenas on th0Esquilina
Hill.

Horace frequently describes his own bodily appearance and
mental ternperament He was of small stature, and had darlr
eyes and black hair, though the latter, as he grew older, becarm

sornewhat gray. In his youth, he was os aweallyconstitutiou‚ .

and suffered from a complaint in hi's eyes. When be reached
the age of manhood, his general health did not much improve,
buthe became stout and corpulent5 so that Augustus used to
joke with him upon his rotundity. ln temperameut, he says, he
was hot; in his youth even passionat05 in his later years easily
irritated, but easily calmed again. His dress was simple, and
rather careless thau elegant. In his mode cf life he studiod
comfort and ease, which never degenerated inm luxury.

This, then, was tho poet of whom Quintilian, the greatest of
Roman critica, remarks, that he was almost the only Latin lyrist
wlro deserved to be read-a judgment which has been fullyrati·
fied by posterity; for scarcely any nation has aver had any lyria
poet who has been so extensively read, admired, and imitated aa
Horace. It is therefore worth while to say something regardiug
his poetry in general, and regardiug the kinds of poetry which
he cultivated.

It is os great importauce for the thorough comprehension and
enjcyment of a poet like Horace, whose excellence consiste in
his having invested the particular circumstances and friendshipa
which led him to write wirh a universal interest, that we should
lrnow when his poems were composed 5 and, even since Bentley
spolre briefly, generally, and without stating proofs, on, this
question, it has been eagerly taken up by every subsequentcom-

mentamr. Horace began his poetical attempta early, aod ooa-
