nnued his antirity till he bad artained a considerable age. He
intended to conclude his poetieal exerticns with the first book of
the Epistles, which he published in the year 20 a. a, when be
was in bis forty-flftb year. Howerer, he still occasionally made
poems (particularly Odes, iv, 1⁴) in celebration of explcits of
members of the reigning family3 and at last, long aller tbe pub·
lication of the first three boolts os Odes, be issued a fourth 3 and ·
besides, by the wisb of Augustus, wrote tbe second boolr of
Epistles. lt is thus certain that Horace himself published his
poema divided into boolrs ς and in regard to the dire Poeticc alone,
it is a possible, but not a probable suppositiou that it was issued
aller its autbor's death. It seems lilrely, therefore, that all of
Horaee's poetry which he himself considered worthy of publi·
oetion, has come down to us.

Horace commences} hie poetical labours in his youth with sati·
rical poetry, which with him assumed two forms-the satire pro·
pcrly so called, and the more lyrical epode. ln the Satires, we
find nc allusion to the battle of Actium, or to the events imme·
diately preceding; they were therefore finished, and perhaps also
publisbed before 32 a. c. h appeart, moreoter, that the rwo boola
were issued together. They were composed on rericus occa·
sicus, partly for the amusement of Maecenas's socialcircle; and
appear tohave been intended originally entirely for the enter·
tainment of private friends. Horace read each separately tc hie
friends, as be composed them ; afterwards be divided them into
bools,anopub1uhso them. They were followed by the book
of Epodes. Some of these Epodes were undoubtedly composed
long before; but we find in the book allusione to the impending
battle between Antony and Octavianus. which held all Italy in
trembling anniam, and also a kind cf triumphal song on the
victory at Actium ; so that the book wama tc have been publisbed
immediately aller it With the Epodes, Horace closed his satirical
poetry. He bad gained a name by it, but bad also made himself
ensmies3 and in his riper years he scirnowledged that it wat not
enough for a person to mark and satirise the faults ofbis fellows,
but that lte must himself attemptto produce something excellent.
He brought the hexameter of the Satires tc perfectiori in the
Epistles‚ and changed the simple iambic verse cf the Epodes for
the strict and artistic metros of the Odes. ‚He llnished the first
three books os the Odes about the year 20 a. c.‚ and publisbed
them together, as appears stom the first Ode, and from the last
of the third book. The first bockof theEpistleswas alsoissued
in tbe year 20 a. c.; and with it, as we hare already obserred,
Horace ¹intended to close his poetical career. Eut in 17 a. e.. at
the empercr’s requam, he wrote the cannen Samiam and soon
allerwarde-ar all events before 1³12. c.-he publisbed tbe fourth
