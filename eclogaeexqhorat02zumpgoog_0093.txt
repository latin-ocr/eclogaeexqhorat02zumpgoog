(rhamnum LIB. 11.

Mysten ademptum, nec tibi Vespero
Surgente decedunt amores
Nec rapidum fugiente solem.

At non ter aevo iunctus amabilem
Plorayit omnes Antilochum senex
Annos, neque impubem parentes
Troilon aut Phrygiae sorores

Flevere semper. Desine mollium
Tandem querelamm, et potins nova
Cantemus Augusti tropaea·

Caesaris et rigidum Niphaten, 20

Medumque flumen gentibus additum
Victis minores volvere vertices,
Intraque praescriptum Gelonos
Exiguis equitare campis.

mission: hence in this passage it is equivalent to perpetuo luges. -
12. Fugiente, scil, Vespero, or rather, with its morning name, Luci· '
jero, ‘when the morning star fleas before the hastemng sun ;¹ that
rs, when day breaks—13. Ter acuo unctus-aenea, Nestor oi
Pylos, who, according to Homer, live to auch an age that he saw
four generations or ages of men. His aon Antilochus was killed by
Memnon before the walls os Troy.-16. Τ roilus was a aon ol
Priam, who, though young and weak, engaged in unaqual strifo
with Achilles, and was alain by him-17. Desine querelarum, a
Greek construction, for which, in prose Latin, the accusative qne·
retas would have to be used- 20. Niphaten. a mountain ol Arme·
nia, here employed to designate the whole os that country. Simi-
larly in the next line the river Medus, which falls into the Araxes,
near the city ol Persepolis, ia used sor tha Parthians, who dwell on
its banks. Hence it isaaid minores uertices volnere, a mixed figumr
soi volvere is quite pro erly used oi the rolling of a river, but
vertex canlbe said only ol the person who is made not to camp ‘his
head’ so high. With minores vertices the English phrase* mnn-
ished beads' may be compared-23. Gelonos, a tribe ol the Scy·
thiens who dwelt in Europe. The poet says of them, that the pre·

datory inroads which they bad been in the habit os making into the
Roman dommrons were now prevented; ‘ that thep ride on y m their

own narrow territorias, wit in the bounda mar ed our to them'
(intra praescri am.) All this praise of the victorias of Augustus
refers to the acts, that in the year 20 aa, Phraates, king of the
Parthians, acknowledged the supremacy of Rome, and reatoredlthe
booty and captives taken in previous campaigns, and that Tiberius,
the ste son ol A ustus, with the help osa Roman army, estab-
lished igranes as ing of Armenia.
