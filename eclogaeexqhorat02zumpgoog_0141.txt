OARMINUM LIB. 111.

Seu rixam et insanos amores
seu facilem, pia testa, sqmnum,

Quocunque lectum nomine Massicum
Sorvae, moveri digna bono die,
Descende Corvino jubente
Promere languidiora vina.

Nou ille, quamquam Socraticis madet
Sermonibus, te neglegit horridus:
Narratur et prisci Catonis
Saepe mero caluisse virtus.

Tu lene tormentum ingenio admoves,
Plerumque duro; tu sapientium
Curae et arcanum 'ocoso
Consilium retegis hysen 3

Tu spem reducis ruentibus anxiis
Viresque et addis cornrm pauperi,

Post te neque iratos trementi
Regum apices neque militum arma. 20

Te Liber et, si laeta aderit, Venus

Segnesque nodum solvere Gratiae
