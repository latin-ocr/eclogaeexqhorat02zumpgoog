” small estate-either a direct present t'rcrn Maecenas, or obtained
by his influence, as compensation sor the patrimonial property
which had been assigned to the veterane. T his estate is the pride
and joy of the poet's beart: here he seels happy in rural seclusion
and slmplicity3 and hither he invites (repeatedly in his Odes)
his particular friends, is they wisb to enjoy country life. He isin
Rome only during the time when he must be there-namely, the
beginning os the year. He returns to his Sabine farm mecon as
he possibly can, and lives there sor the remainder ot the year3
except when he goes, as the state os his health osten obliges him
tc do, tc the warrn baths cs Balae, or to the sea-bathing at some
town in southern Italy.

The situation and appearance oi this celebrated Iarrn may be
pretty well determined from the nctices which he gives ln Epist.
i. 14, 16, and 183 and Sat. ii. 6. We cross over to the right bank
os the Anio at Tibur (the modern Tivoli), and then go up along
the river, following the cic Valerio, as sar as the little village os
Varia (now Vicovaro.) This village lies to the lestof the public
road, on a hill above the Aulo, eIght Roman miles from Tibur.
Hcruce's estate was in the district connected with this village3
and had, in earlier times, when lauded property in Italy was
distributed among mcre persons, sufficed sor the support of five
familiae: now it was cultivated for Horace by eight slaves. It
was situated in a valley, which lay in thedirection from north tc
south3 so that the hill on the right was gilded by the bearna οἱ the
morning sau, that cn the leit by hie evening rays. A consider·
able riuulet, called the Digentia (now LIcenza), flows through
the middle of the valley, falling intotheAnio aboutamileabcve
Varia. Thus sar the locality is certain, andcan at present easily
be found ; but tha exact place where the villa stood it is scarcely
possible to fix, since it was certainly not so magnificent or laeting
that traces of it should remain till now· Horace, in Odes iii. 13,
mentions a fone Bandusiae as springiug up near his farm. 1r this
was the largest oi the numerous brooks which bubble up cnthe
slope of the hill ou the right side os the Digentia, then the villa
must have been situated some three miles up the valley. T here
. was connected with this hausein the country a house in Tibur,
according tc a custom which still holds iu the smaller towns os
Italy, thar to each house s certain piece oi land belongs, on which
again may be a villa. The poet, therefore, osten praises Tibur aa
his darlIng residence, where the Muses favoured him most, and
where he wished that he might remain in his old age. Suetonius,
iu hie hlography os Horace, says, Varii plurimran ἐπ naara narb
micetmicet Tiburtini: mmasqw aaa ostenditur circa Tiburni
landam. Now the grove oi Tiburnus, anold local god of Tibur,
