SATIRARUM

urana paruus

SA'HRA 1.

Omvsmorrs, firll of wit and good practical morality, on the uni·
versally-preralent vice of dissatirfaetion with one's own position
in life-on the eager desire uf possesring more than others-end
the avarice which would ever accumulate and never begin to
enjuy what has been acquired. This constant burtle ir repre-
sented as the most dangerous enemy of a quiet, reflective, happy ⁴
life; and no doubt the morning, not unnecessarily to distract
their minds, was very reasonable to the Romans at this period
(some yea‘rs before the battle of Actium), when property was in
a most unsettled state, and peace had been long unknown to the
republic. But the moral precepts are persectly applicable to tho
rnen of the present age also.

Seu ratio dederit, seu sors objecerit, illa

Contentus vivat, laudet diversa sequentes‘l

Miles ait multo jam tractus membra labore. d
Contra mercator, navem jactantibus austris:

‘Militia est potior. Quid eniml concurritur: horae
Memento aut cita mors venit aut victoria laets!

Agricolam laudat juris legumque peritus,

Sub galli cautum consultor ubi ostia pulsat. ll)
Ille datis vadibus qui rure extractus in urbem est,

Solos felices virentes clamat in urbe.
Cetera de genere hoc (adeo sunt multa) loquacem
Delassare valent Fabium. Ne te morer, aud

Quo rem deducam. Si quis deus, ‘En egq’ dicat, 15

duc. contentus vivat. As toqui, ‘h0w,' see Gram. t 118, note-2.
Fors, not Fortuna, but ‘accident‚ chance,' the opposite of ratio,
