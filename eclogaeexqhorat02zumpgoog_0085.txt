antoninum ΗΒ. 11.

Sed ne relictis, Musa procax, jocis
Ceae retractes munera naeniae:
Mecum Dionaeo sub antro
Quaere modos leviore plectro. 40

Dauniae, properly=Apuluc (Carm. i. 22, 14); hete=Romaaae.-37‚
The poet, when about to go on at some length wirh this lamentarer
the crvrl wars, recollects that his qeneral purpose is to write only

jocular poenis (jori) os a lighter cass (leviore plectro). not ele ies
(naeniae) such as, erewhile. the renowned poet, Simonides ol os,
composed: hence, now, Horace restrains the gush oi his sorrow.-

samaritamus antro. Dione, properly tha mother oi Venus,is
sometimes, as here, Venus herself.
