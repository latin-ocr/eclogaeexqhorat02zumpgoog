Sic te diva. ensC pri,
Sic fratres bidense, incida sidem,

Ventorumque regat pater
Obstrietis eliis praeter Iapyga,
Navis, quae tibi creditam
Debes Virgilium, finibus Atticis
Reddas ineolumem, precor,
Et serves animae dimidium meae.
Illi robur et aes triplex
Circa pectus eret, qui fragilem truci
Commisit pelago ratem
Primus, nee timuit praecipitem Africum
