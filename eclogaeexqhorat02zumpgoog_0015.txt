external advantages Horace was indebted to aba favour and
friendship of Maecenas: the literary friends whom he met at
his house encouraged him to poetical activity and to improve-
ment in ths art; and there, too, he became acquainted with many
meu of power and influencc in the state. lt would have ‘been
easy for him to alter his position in regard to Maecenas, and to
atrike out sor himself a path to honour and authority, hut how
⁸ little he thought oi this appears from his conduct to Augustus.
Maecenas had spoken of Horace to th0 emperor, and had given
him a copy of his p00m83 with which, being a man ol teste, and
from disposition as well as from political motives a patron cf
literature, he expressed himself as delighted. He wanted a
secretary to write letters for him, and aslred Maecenas to give
up Horace to him. Maecenas consented3 but Horace pleaded ,
the weak state of his health, to escape taking the office, which
would have given him much influence, but at the same time
much trouble. Augustus admitted the excuse, and was not
angry; but he wished that Horace would speak of his exploits
in his poems, or rather that he would write a poem upon them,
and hs felt hurt. that the poet had not mentioned himin any
previous production. But Horace declined to attempt any such
N panegyric, his reason being either that which he gave-namen,
that he had no talant sor spic poetry-or, as is mors probabis,
that hs hated flattery. He had in his¹ youth belonged to tlte
republican party; and though in his maturet years he felt and
aclrnowledged thm the restoration of the republic was impossible,
and the goverrtrneut of Augustus beneficent, still he was unwill-
ing toact in such a manner as indirectly to depreciate the merits
of those heroes who had formerly bean the gods of his idolatry.
But he osten praised the administraticn cf Augustus, which had,
in autb,- induced contentment and excited gratitude in all-
sxtolling hirn for having given to ltaly and the Roman Empire
the long wished-for blessings of peace, for having, by successful
battles,extendedand secured me houndaries of his dominicum
sud for labouring most asalously, by good institutions aud wisa
laws, to elevata the moral condition of the people. It was not
till alter prassing requests from Augustus, which he could not
refuse without giving great offense, that Horace resolved to cele·
brata in two odes the victorias of Tiberius and Drusus, the step·
sons of the emperor, and for this reason to add a fourth book
of Odes to the three which were already in the hands of the
public. The epistle to Augustus (Epic. ii. 1) was written on the
same occasion.

Maecenas, particularly when he grew old, and fell into had
health, also made demands upon the poet which he could not
reconcila with his principles, and this was probably the reason
