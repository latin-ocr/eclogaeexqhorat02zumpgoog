No ancient writer has been so thoroughly subjected to all kinds
os criticism as Horace. The number ol those who, in ancient
and modern times, have published editions os his whole νοτὶς, ,
or os detached portione, is so great, that the mere enumeration
os them would requires volume. We might suppose at first
glauce that all the aids which can be desired in regard to an
ancient author—grammarians, manuscriptaand commentators—
exist in rich abundance sor Horace; and yet, upon a closer
examination, we ilnd that much still remains to hedone. Two
ancient grammarians have leit commentaries on Horace-namen,-
Helenius Acron end Pomponius Porphyrion. They lived towards
the close os the fllth century aiter Christ3 but their scholia, aa
they have corne down tous, are to a great extentmixed up with ,
later commenta. Besides these, Jacob Cruquius, in his edition
(Antwerp, 1678),11as made up an ancient commentary from the
marginal notes oi four Codices Blandinioni, so called srom the
Blandin monastery on the Blandin Hill, in Ghent. These ancient
scholia are not so good as those which we possess on some other
writers3 but they are useiul on account os the interesting end
valuable information which they contain regarding persons men·
tioned by Horace, particularly in the Satires, and which these ᾗ
commentatore had extracted from earlier boolrs dc personis Horo
tionis. Consequently, in every edition oi the poet they must be
mentioned and made use ot '

There are more than two hundred manuscripts oi Horace in
existence, some os them very good. The above-mentioned Bion·
. diuisui, made use os by Cruquius, were particularly excellent,
butaro now lost Only a sew os the othershave been thoronghly
collated; and it is matter oi astonishment thet, notwithstand- Α
ing the number oi editions, a text oi the Horatian poema, really ’
founded on the manuscripts, and critically emended, is stilla

desideratum. The first whopublished an edition os Horace with , ’

a commentary was christophorus Laudinus (Florence‚1482);
