Q. nonnata FLAGOI

Me fabulosae Volture in Appula
Altricis extra limen Apuliae
Ludo fatigatumque somno
Fronde nova puerum palumbes

Tenere (mirum quod leret omnibus,
Quicunque celsae nidum Acherontiae
Saltusque Bantinos et arvum
'Pingue tenent humilis Forenti),

Ut tuto ab atris corpore viperis

· ¹ Dormirem et ursis, ut premerer sacra
Lauroquc collataque myrto,
Non sine dis animosus infans.

Vester, Camenae, vester in arduos
Tollor Sabinos, seu mihi frigidum
Praeneste, seu Tibur supinum,
seu liquidae placuere Baiae.
