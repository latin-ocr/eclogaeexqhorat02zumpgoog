INTRODUGTION.

 

the most celebrated lyric poet
os the Romans, and who in all
ages, and among all nations
„ ’ which have felt an interest in
Ξ, poetry and intellectual culture,
Ξ » has been greatly admired and
- much imitated, was born in the
= year 65 n. c., in the consulship
¹· ζ, f· of L. Manlius Torquatus and

L. Aurelius Cotta. Hence in
Odes, iii. 21, he addresses to an
amphora the words Ο nata
mecum oonmle Manli05 and in

*Epist i. 20, he mentions that m
the December of 21 n. c., he had completed his forty· ·sourth

year. December was therefore his birth —3month and we learn
from a short notice of Horace’ s lise, which probably formed a
chapter in Suetonius' Lives of the Roman Poets, that the day
was the 8thof the month (a. d. vi. Id Dec.) Horace was conse-
quently six years younger than Livy, five years younger than virgil,
and two years older than Augustus. His native place was
Venusia, an ancient Latin colony, which, at the time os the
Social War, 91 n. c., had received the suu Roman franchise,
and was consequentlya municipium. Venusia was in Apulia,
but just on the confines os Lucania3 in which, indeed, a part
os the territory belonging to it in later times was situated.
Hence Horace, in Sat. ii. 1,34, in speaking of himself, jokingly
says, Lucanus an Appulus anema. His father belonged to the
lowest class of freernen: he was a freedman (libertinas), which
indicates that he had formerly been a slave3 and had, upon
his manumission, assumed the name of his matera-Horatius.
whether he had a cognomen or not, is unknown. Thac of
Flaccus, which his son bore, was properly given to persons with

long loose ears,
