Imbelli cithara carmina divides,
N equiequam thalamo graves
Hastas et calami spicula Cnosii
Vitabis strepitumque et celerem sequi

⁴ Non Laertiaden, exitium tuae
Genti, non Pylium Nestora respicis?
Urgent impavidi te Salaminius
Teucer, te Sthenelus sciens

Quem tu, cervus nti vallis in altera
Visum parte lupum graminis immemor,
Sublimi fugies mollis anhelitu,

Non hoc pollicitus tuae.
